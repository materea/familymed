                  <h4>Introduction to Medical Ethics</h4>

                  <p>Ethics is the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to various fields, including medicine. Medical ethics specifically deals with the moral principles guiding healthcare practitioners in their interactions with patients, colleagues, and society.</p>
                
                  <h4>Medical Ethics Principles</h4>
                  <p>The key principles of medical ethics include:</p>
                
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Patients have the right to decide what happens to their own bodies, and physicians should respect well-informed decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Physicians must act in the best interest of the patient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Maleficence:</strong> Physicians should do no harm, and any harm caused unintentionally must be minimized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Fair distribution of resources, considering competing needs, rights, obligations, and potential conflicts with established laws.</li>
                  </ol>
                
                  <h4>Medical Etiquette</h4>
                  <p>Observing conventional laws and customs of courtesy within the medical profession, including maintaining confidentiality and respecting hierarchy.</p>
                
                  <h4>Doctor's Duties</h4>
                  <p>Duties to the patient, the state, and colleagues, including maintaining professional secrecy, notification of infectious diseases, and treating colleagues with respect.</p>
                        
                  <h4>Privileged Communication:</h4>
                  <p>Confidentiality exceptions include:</p>

              <li>Non-maleficence</li>
              <li>Justice</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Principles of Medical Ethics</h4>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Implies that the patient has the right to decide what shall happen to his own body. The physician should adequately inform the patient and thereafter respect their well-informed decisions/wishes.</li>
              <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Implies that the physician must always act in the best interest of the patient.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Maleficence:</strong> 'Above all, Do no Harm' (or the least harm as the case may be). Note: When the physician‚Äôs treatment produces the desired positive outcome but causes harm, it is known as the "<strong>double effect</strong>." For example, using morphine to relieve cancer pains in an elderly dying patient, which can hasten his demise through respiratory suppression.</li>
              <li><strong>Justice:</strong>The principle of ‚Äúfairness and equality‚Äù in deciding who gets what when distributing scarce resources. It implies equal distribution among all groups in the community of the burdens and benefits of new or experimental treatments. Here are four main areas to note in considering justice:</li>              
              <ol>
                <li>Fair distribution of scarce resources</li>
                <li>Competing needs</li>
                <li>Rights and obligations</li>
                <li>Potential conflicts with established legislations</li>
              </ol>
            </ul>

            <h4>Medical Etiquette</h4>

            <p>Medical etiquette refers to conventional laws and customs of courtesy observed between members of the medical profession. Don‚Äôt forget that there is ‚Äòheirarchy in Medicine‚Äô.</p>
            
            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

            <p>This means keeping as top secret your dealings with the patient. It is wrong for a doctor to divulge the information about his patient to another person without the patient‚Äôs consent.</p>
            
            <p>Exceptions are:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>When the patient gives written and valid consent</li>
              <li>Divulging the information to other health care providers in the course of the patient‚Äôs management</li>
              <li>Close relatives can be informed when it is undesirable to seek consent</li>
              <li>Statutory requirement or court order that a given information be made public</li>
              <li>If it is in the interest of the public</li>
              <li>If in the respect of an approved research</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Consent</h4>

            <p>This is an agreement, compliance, or permission given voluntarily without compulsion. It can be:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Express
                <ul>
                  <li>Verbal</li>
                  <li>Written</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Implied</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Informed Consent</h4>
            
            <p>This is the very foundation of the patient-doctor relationship. Most medical litigations revolve around deficiencies in the process of obtaining informed consent for medical care. Informed consent implies consensus or a meeting of minds and not a mere completion of a form. If the essential ingredients are lacking, then of course informed consent cannot be said to exist despite a signed informed consent form.</p>
            
            <p>This principle is based on the fact that ‚ÄúEvery human being has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body.‚Äù</p>

            <p>It requires a full disclosure and discussion of the proposed medical or operative procedure, including its risks, complications, alternatives, and their risks, and reasonable expectations.</p>
            
            <p>It is more than just signing a form. It is a sensitive issue and must never be trivialized.</p>
            
            <p>Documentation of your discussion with the patient is key - <i>whatever was not documented did not occur.</i> </p>
            
            <p>Consent from minors and patients with mental capacity is not valid. Patients below 18 years are Minors in Nigeria - parents or guardians give <strong><i>assent</i></strong> in that case.</p>
