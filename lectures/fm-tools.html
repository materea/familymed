            <h4>Drawing a Genogram</h4>

            <h5>Genogram Information</h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biodata:</strong> Names, age (DOB), marital status, former marriages, occupation.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Relations:</strong> Children, marriages (date), households.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical:</strong> Illnesses, dates of traumatic events and deaths (age, date, cause).</li>
                <li><strong>Psychosocial:</strong> Emotional closeness/distance, family conflicts, divorce (date).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Include information for at least three generations.</p>

            <h4>Genogram Layout Guidelines</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Title</strong></li>
                <li>The firstborn members of each genogram are the farthest to the left, with siblings following to the right in order of birth.</li>
                <li>The standard family genogram chart consists of three or more generations, representing all members of both spouses‚Äô families.</li>
                <li>It is traditional to place the husband‚Äôs symbol on the left.</li>
                <li>A single generation is represented on the same line, and symbols should all be the same size.</li>
                <li>The children of the first generation are indicated on the next generation line; in later generations, the first pregnancy (or child) is placed on the left.</li>
                <li>The family name is placed above each major family unit, and the given names are placed below each symbol.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <ul>
                <li>It can take an average of 15 minutes to complete a genogram, especially when patients are new to the practice.</li>
                <li>It is not compulsory to complete the genogram in one visit.</li>
                <li>The process helps build rapport and enhances the doctor-patient relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Genogram May Reveal</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Transgenerational family patterns of loss (separation, divorce, death).</li>
                <li>Dysfunctional emotional patterns (substance abuse, domestic violence, etc).</li>
                <li>Common medical problems (asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus).</li>
            </ul>
