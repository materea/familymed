            <p>Holistic Medicine, on the other hand, has been described as the art and science that addresses the whole person and integrates conventional and complementary therapies to prevent and treat disease, but most importantly to promote optimal health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Broader term</strong></p>
            
            <p>Holistic Medicine is based on these tenets:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Holism:</strong> It follows the philosophy of treating the whole person‚Äî mind, body, and spirit‚Äîfor achieving healing.</li>
              <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Holistic medicine combines various approaches, including alternative therapies, to promote overall wellness.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-Healing:</strong> It recognizes the human body as a self-healing organism and focuses on supporting this inherent healing process.</li>
              <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Holistic medicine is not just about medical treatment; it‚Äôs also a way of life that promotes well-being.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <p>HM encompasses a wide array of healing practices that consider the whole person‚Äîbody, mind, spirit, and emotions‚Äîin the pursuit of optimal health and wellness. Here are some examples:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Acupuncture and Acupressure:</strong> Involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate energy flow and promote balance.<br>
                <p><strong>Acupressure</strong> involves applying pressure to these same points without using needles.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ayurveda:</strong> An ancient system from India, Ayurveda focuses on balancing the body's energies (doshas) through diet, herbs, and lifestyle practices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Homeopathy:</strong> Homeopathic remedies use highly diluted substances to stimulate the body's self-healing abilities. The principle is "like cures like," where a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can treat similar symptoms in an ill person.
              </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Naturopathy:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Naturopathic doctors emphasize natural remedies, nutrition, and lifestyle changes.</li>
                    <li>They may use herbal medicine, dietary supplements, hydrotherapy, and other non-invasive therapies.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>TCM includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, and qigong.</li>
                    <li>It aims to balance the body's vital energy (qi) and maintain harmony.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mind-Body Medicine:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Practices like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and guided imagery promote mental and emotional well-being.</li>
                    <li>They recognize the mind's influence on physical health.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Remember, holistic medicine treats the whole person, addresses root causes, and encourages collaboration between patient and practitioner. Whether it's massage, meditation, or nutritional counseling, these approaches contribute to a holistic view of health and healing.</p>
