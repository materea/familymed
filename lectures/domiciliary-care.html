            <ul>
              <li>Home Care, (also referred to as domiciliary care or social care), is health care or supportive care provided in the patient's home.</li>
              <li>Home care services can be classified into <strong>preventive</strong>, <strong>promotive</strong>, <strong>therapeutic</strong>, <strong>rehabilitative</strong>, <strong>long-term maintenance</strong>, and <strong>palliative care</strong> categories.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>
              Home care is defined as the provision of health services by formal and informal caregivers in the home in order to promote, restore, and maintain a person‚Äôs maximum level of comfort, function, and health including care towards a dignified death.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is an integral part of community-based care.</li>
              <li>Community-based care is the care that the consumer can access nearest to home, which encourages participation by people, responds to the needs of people, encourages traditional community life, and creates responsibilities.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Members of <strong>Roman Catholic</strong> religious orders in Europe first delivered <strong>HC</strong> in the late seventeenth century.</li>
              <li>From <strong>1885</strong> to <strong>1889</strong>, most nurses' workplace was in the home of their clients.</li>
              <li>Today, there are many <strong>home care agencies</strong> and <strong>visiting nurse associations</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h4>Rationale for Home-Based Care</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Due to the epidemic of <strong>AIDS</strong>, the increase in <strong>noncommunicable diseases</strong>, the complications thereof, and an ageing population‚Äôs impending impact on communities.</li>
              <li>Shortage of hospital beds.</li>
              <li>Inadequate number of medical, nursing, and allied health professionals in the public sector.</li>
              <li>Hospitals, which are crowded and over-stretched, are often unsuitable for managing patients with terminal or long-term diseases.</li>
              <li>Cost of institutional care.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h4>Immobility</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Evaluation of the patient's functional activities includes assessment of the activities of daily living (bathing, transfer, dressing, toileting, feeding, continence) and the instrumental activities of daily living (using the telephone, administering medications, paying bills, shopping for food, preparing meals, doing housework).</li>
                      <li>The physician can ask the patient to demonstrate elements of the daily routine, such as getting out of bed, performing personal hygiene and leisure activities, and getting in and out of a car.</li>
                      <li>Corrective interventions can be directed at any deficiencies noted. For example, modified pill-bottle caps can be obtained for the patient who has trouble opening medication containers because of a condition such as arthritis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The physician should assess the patient's current state of nutrition, eating behaviors, and food preferences. Permission to look in the refrigerator or cupboard can be obtained by asking open-ended but directed questions.</li>
                      <li>"Would you mind if I look in your refrigerator to see the types of foods you eat?"</li>
                      <li>Improvements in product labeling allow the physician to assess serving sizes and the nutritional value of foods with relative ease.</li>
                      <li>Healthy food preparation techniques can also be reviewed with the patient.</li>
                    </ul>

                    
                    <h4>Home Environment</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The patient's home environment should allow for privacy, social interaction, and both spiritual and emotional comfort and safety.</li>
                      <li>A safe neighborhood with close proximity to services is important for many older patients.</li>
                      <li>The home may reflect pride in the patient's family and past accomplishments and reveal the patient's interests and hobbies.</li>
                      <li>The physician should not make assumptions about social class or material wealth based on the patient's physical environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Other People</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Having the patient's social support system present at the home visit clarifies the roles and concerns of family members.</li>
                      <li>During routine visits, the physician can assess the availability of emergency help for the patient from family members and friends and can clarify specific issues, such as who is to serve as surrogate for the patient in the event of incapacitation.</li>
                      <li>Evaluation of the caregiver's needs and risk of burnout is critically important.</li>
                    </ul>

                    
                    <h4>Medications</h4>

                    <ul>
                      <li>To avoid polypharmacy, the physician must evaluate the type, amount, and frequency of medications, and the organization and methods of medication delivery.</li>
                      <li>An inventory of the patient's medicine cabinet can provide clues to previously unidentified drug-drug or drug-food interactions.</li>
                      <li>A home medication review can also allow a direct estimate of patient compliance, uncover evidence of "doctor shopping," and identify the use or abuse of over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Examination</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The home visit should include a directed physical examination based on the needs of the patient and the physician's agenda.</li>
                      <li>Practical, function-related examination techniques may include having the patient demonstrate getting on and off the toilet or in and out of the bathtub.</li>
                      <li>The physician can have the patient demonstrate proper technique for the self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. In addition, the physician can weigh the patient and obtain a blood pressure measurement.</li>
                      <li>In-person correlation of home and office measures provides useful information for future telephone and clinic contacts.</li>
                    </ul>


                    
                    <h4>Safety</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The goal of the home safety assessment is to determine whether the patient's environment is comfortable and safe (no unreasonable risk of injury).</li>
                      <li>To raise the subject, the physician should simply state the intention to identify and help modify potential safety hazards.</li>
                      <li>For example, furniture placement or rugs may create problems for an elderly patient with gait instability, or the tap water may be so hot that the patient is at risk for scald injury.</li>
                    </ul>

                    

                    <h4>Spiritual Health</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the home contains religious objects or reading materials, the physician can ask about the influence of spiritual beliefs on the patient's sense of physical and emotional health.</li>
                      <li>This information may provide the impetus, as desired by the patient, for a discussion of spirituality as a coping and healing strategy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    
                    <h4>Services</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Having members of cooperating home health agencies present for the house call can enhance communication and cooperation among the physician, patient, and agencies.</li>
                      <li>Existing orders can be clarified, priorities for future care can be established, and other perspectives on the care plan can be solicited.</li>
                      <li>The patient's relationship with home health agency providers can also be assessed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    
                    
                    <p> Elements of the INHOMESSS mnemonic may be used independently, based on the needs of the patient and the physician's agenda.</p>
                    <p>For example, the physician may wish to focus on polypharmacy and safety in a patient with a recent fall, or to assess mobility and the extent of social support in a patient with newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Proactive telephone calls are an underutilized method of conducting highly focused and time-efficient "virtual" home visits.</li>
              <li>Provider-initiated telephone calls can be used to reassure family members after a patient has had an acute illness or has been hospitalized.</li>
              <li>Telemedicine is the use of communication technologies to provide patient care across distances.</li>
              <li>A variety of institutions are exploring these technologies as methods of delivering health care in the home.</li>

              <li>Lack of reimbursement and the busy pace of office practice are the reasons commonly cited for not conducting house calls.</li>
              <li>Poorly organized, sporadic home visits may indeed interfere with clinical practice.</li>
              <li>Therefore, it is important to develop a systematic approach for planning home visits.</li>
              <li>Most practices will benefit from using home visits with patients who have difficulty accessing outpatient facilities because of sensory impairment, immobility, or transportation problems.</li>
              <li>Removing such logistically difficult appointments from the clinic schedule and performing them in the home setting may actually enhance clinic functioning.</li>
              <li>Clustering home visits by geographic location and within defined blocks of time may also improve efficiency.</li>
              <li>Finally, nurses and physician assistants can conduct visits as part of a home health care delivery team.</li>
