            <p><strong>Family Care:</strong> Central to the practice of family medicine is the understanding of the concept of what the family is, the dynamics of its processes and the components of its care.</p>
            <p><strong>Primary Care:</strong> Primary medical care and primary healthcare.</p>
            <p>Primary medical care is used to refer to all care delivered at the first or primary level in contrast with care delivered in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Primary health care in its broadest sense is a philosophy or set of values and principles for organizing the health system as a whole.</p>
            <p><strong>Hospital Care:</strong> FP provides comprehensive healthcare to patients within the hospital and as a generalist specialist especially in rural areas.</p>
