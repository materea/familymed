          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>Domestic violence is a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain <strong>power and control</strong> over another intimate/related partner.</p>
          <p>The definition adds that domestic violence can happen to and can be perpetrated by anyone regardless of <strong>race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender</strong>, and can take many forms, including <strong>physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, economic, and psychological abuse</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>Domestic violence encompasses domestic abuse, intimate partner violence, battering, family violence, and spousal abuse.</p>
          <p>It is a pattern of abusive behaviors by one partner against another in an intimate relationship such as marriage or dating, in a family or cohabitation.</p>
          <p>As a rule, domestic violence does not describe a single violent event, but rather a complex system of abuse that can include physical, economic, psychological, and sexual violence.</p>

            <h4>Forms of Domestic Violence</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects)</li>
              <li>Sexual abuse</li>
              <li>Emotional abuse</li>
              <li>Controlling or domineering</li>
              <li>Intimidation</li>
              <li>Stalking</li>
              <li>Passive/covert abuse otherwise known as neglect</li>
              <li>Economic deprivation</li>
            </ul>
          <p>(Reference: Seimeniuk, Krentz, Gish & Gill, 2010)</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Domestic violence is a social problem that, although well recognized, is still associated with uncertainty and taboos.</li>
            <li>Many men, women, and children, in their intimate relationships or immediate social environment, regardless of social status or ethnicity, experience psychological and/or physical violence, which becomes a serious health problem for them.</li>
            <li>Since the police are rarely notified in cases of domestic violence, the estimated number of unknown cases is high (most cases remain unreported/unrecorded) and reliable epidemiological data are scarce and may not truly reflect the actual state.</li>
            <li>The actual extent of violence can only be assumed, as it is not easy for the affected person to speak about their experiences or to ask for help in most cases.</li>
            <li>The reasons for this may be feelings of shame or guilt, fear, or perceptions based on traditional ideas of marriage and family and inherent customs of the people in the domiciled society.</li>

            <li>Anyone can be a victim.</li>
            <li>Globally, women are the major victims and also tend to experience more severe forms of violence.</li>
            <li>In some societies, domestic violence is justified and legally permitted, especially in cases of actual/suspected infidelity on the part of the woman.</li>
            <li>Research has established a direct and significant correlation between a country's level of gender equality and rates of domestic violence: less gender equality, higher rates of domestic violence.</li>
            <li>In the US each year, women experience <strong>4.8 million</strong> intimate partner-related physical assaults and rapes. Men ‚Äì <strong>2.9 million</strong>.</li>
            <li>Up to <strong>2.5 million</strong> older Americans suffer some form of elder mistreatment each year.</li>
            <li>Women are six times more likely to be assaulted by an intimate partner than men.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women.</p>
          <p>Worldwide, domestic violence is considered as one of the most frequent forms of gender-based violence.</p>
          <p>In various European countries, the lifetime prevalence of violence in intimate partnerships is reported to be between <strong>10%</strong> and <strong>36%</strong>.</p>
          <p>One US study shows that among <strong>3455</strong> patients from <strong>11</strong> different emergency medicine providers, <strong>37%</strong> have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from a current or former intimate partner at some point in their lives. Of these, <strong>14.4%</strong> reported abuse within <strong>12 months</strong> prior to the survey, and <strong>2.2%</strong> were seeking medical care due to a current act of violence.</p>
         
          
          <ul>
            <li>In parts of the 3rd world ‚Äì prevalent, justified, and condoned.</li>
            <li><strong>56%</strong> of Indian Women justified wife beating for various reasons.</li>
            <li><strong>25%</strong> of women in Dakar are subjected to physical violence from their partners, very few admit it. Law passed punishing Domestic Violence is poorly enforced due to religious and cultural resistance (IRIN, 2007).</li>
            <li>Many victims don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve been abused or not.</li>
            <li>Nigeria ‚Äì <strong>1/3rd</strong> of women have been subjected to physical, sexual, and psychological violence. (Afrol News, 2007)</li>
            <li>Beating of wives and children widely sanctioned as a form of discipline (UNICEF 2001).</li>
            <li>In Lagos - <strong>66.4%</strong> and <strong>50.4%</strong> of ever married and unmarried women respectively expressed consent for wife beating (Project alert, 2001).</li>
            <li>In SE Nigeria ‚Äì <strong>70%</strong> respondents reported abuse in their family (Obi and Ozumba, 2005).</li>
            <li>In a study conducted by Dr. B. A. Ayinmode and Prof. Mrs. M. F. Tunde-Ayinmode studies in UITH (2008):
              <ul>
                <li>250 participants.</li>
                <li><strong>69</strong> (28%) reported cases.</li>
                <li><strong>49</strong> within 2 years of the study.</li>

          <p>Lenore Walker presented the model of a Cycle of violence which consists of three basic phases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Tension Building Phase:</strong> Characterized by poor communication, tension, fear of causing outbursts. During this stage the victims try to calm the abuser down, to avoid any major violent confrontations.</li>
            <li><strong>Violent Episode:</strong> Characterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents. During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate his/her partner (victim).</li>
            <li><strong>Honeymoon Phase:</strong> Characterized by affection, apology, and apparent end of violence.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Reasons Victims Don't Leave</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>FEAR</strong></li>
            <li><strong>LOW SELF ESTEEM</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ISOLATION</strong></li>
            <li><strong>LACK OF RESOURCES</strong></li>
            <li><strong>PROMISES TO CHANGE</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO LEAVE!</strong> They leave when they are ready. They leave when it is safe to do so. We can support their process by providing an institutional response affirming battered victims and their decision-making ability.</p>
